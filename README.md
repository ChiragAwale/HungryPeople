## Inspiration
Our main inspiration was to help small businesses survive difficult times like the pandemic. Hungry people gives everyone a platform for their business where anyone can look through their menu and order from anywhere.

## What it does
Hungry People provides a simple and easy to use interface which lets businesses post their details like their contact information, hours and menu from which customers can order. Customers can see all the nearby businesses and pick a restaurant from which they want to order. When they place an order, HungryPeople sends a notification to the business telling them what the customer ordered and when they're coming to pick up.

## How we built it
We built the android application using android studio and Java. The back-end is handled through a REST API built on Django framework and hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The Android app uses the endpoints from the API to get data from the server and displays the relevant content to the user.

## Challenges we ran into
Getting the API to work the way we wanted proved to be very difficult. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the team being relatively new to both Android and Django, we feel like we've done a decent amount of work in 36 hours which does represent our main idea for the app. 

## What we learned
Teamwork makes the Dream work.

## What's next for HungryPeople
Ability to order from a website. 
Ability to receive orders from texts so businesses which do not have Wifi on premises can still use the app.
Support for small stores.
